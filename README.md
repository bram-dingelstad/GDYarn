# GDYarn

## Todo's

[x] Make most emitters emit relevant contextual information like lines
[ ] Improve general code styling
[ ] Make YarnRunner default implementation with sane defaults
[ ] Rework data types to be closer to native gdscript types like dicts
[ ] Convert essential `FuncRef`s to `signal`s 
[ ] Rename dir structure to `gdyarn` instead of `kyper_gdyarn`
[ ] Supply a bunch of test yarn files to test specifications better
[ ] Remove all instances of overly explicit type declarations
[ ] Fix visit counts
[ ] (Maybe) Make `variables_storage` just any dict reference instead of a `Node` 
[ ] (Maybe) Look into import pre-compilation
